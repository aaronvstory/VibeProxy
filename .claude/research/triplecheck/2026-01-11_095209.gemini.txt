    "severity": "MEDIUM",
    "title": "Blocking UI in Write-Toast",
    "details": "The 'Write-Toast' function uses 'Start-Sleep' for its duration. Since PowerShell is single-threaded, this completely freezes the TUI during the toast display, preventing any user input or background status refreshes.",
    "file": "VibeProxy-Manager.ps1",
    "line": 257,
    "recommendation": "For a TUI, consider a non-blocking approach using a timestamp check in the main loop, or keep the sleep duration very short (e.g., 500ms) for 'Success' messages so as not to frustrate power users."

    "severity": "LOW",
    "title": "Hardcoded Terminal Width in UI Drawing",
    "details": "Functions like 'Write-Footer' and 'Write-ModelInfoPanel' use hardcoded line lengths (71 and 65 characters). If the user's terminal is smaller than this, the boxes and lines will wrap, breaking the visual layout.",
    "file": "VibeProxy-Manager.ps1",
    "line": 67,
    "recommendation": "Use '$Host.UI.RawUI.WindowSize.Width' to calculate dynamic widths or at least verify the window meets a minimum width requirement at startup."

    "title": "Inefficient Property Update in Switch-A0Config",
    "details": "Inside the loop at line 1268, 'Add-Member -Force' is called for every setting. For PSCustomObjects (returned by ConvertFrom-Json), simple assignment '$currentSettings.$setting = ...' is both faster and more idiomatic in modern PowerShell.",

    "line": 1268,
    "recommendation": "Replace the Add-Member call with: $currentSettings.$setting = $newConfig.$setting"

  {
    "severity": "LOW",
    "title": "Inconsistent Null Checks for Model IDs",
    "details": "The code added several checks like '-not [string]::IsNullOrWhiteSpace($ModelId)', which is great, but 'Get-ProviderFromModelId' (Line 104) and 'Format-ModelDisplayName' use different patterns for the same validation.",
    "file": "VibeProxy-Manager.ps1",
    "line": 104,
    "recommendation": "Standardize on a single validation helper or the [string]::IsNullOrWhiteSpace() method across all model-related functions."

    "severity": "MEDIUM",
    "title": "Potential JSON Corruption on Empty Settings",
    "details": "In 'Switch-A0Config', if 'Get-Content' fails or the file is temporarily locked, '$currentSettings' could be null, and the subsequent 'ConvertTo-Json | Set-Content' might overwrite the settings file with 'null' or an empty string.",
    "file": "VibeProxy-Manager.ps1",
    "line": 1285,
    "recommendation": "Add a check: if ($null -ne $currentSettings) { ... save ... } to prevent wiping the config on a read failure."

    "details": "The 'Write-ModelInfoPanel' performs a live 'Invoke-RestMethod' call. If the SSH tunnel is 'half-open' (connection accepted but no response), the 3-second timeout will cause the entire Main Menu to hang for 3 seconds every time it refreshes or the user makes a selection.",
    "file": "VibeProxy-Manager.ps1",
    "line": 147,
    "recommendation": "Cache the live model count/list and refresh it in the background or only when the user explicitly requests a refresh (e.g., via the 'R' key in the browser)."

### Summary
The updates significantly improve the visual hierarchy and information density of the VibeProxy Manager. The addition of the `ModelInfoPanel` and `StatusBar` creates a "Dashboard" feel that makes the tool much more professional. However, the primary risks are **thread blocking**: the use of synchronous API calls and `Start-Sleep` within the UI rendering logic can lead to a "stuttery" experience if the network tunnel isn't performing perfectly. Moving toward a simple polling/caching mechanism for the live API data would make the UI feel much more responsive.
